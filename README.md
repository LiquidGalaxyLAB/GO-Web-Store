# GO Web Store  

**GO Web Store** is a dedicated platform for Liquid Galaxy applications, including Google Earth and Chromium-based apps, Progressive Web Apps (PWAs), and data visualization projects. These apps have been developed over time, many as part of the Google Summer of Code initiative.  

**Why "GO"?**  
The name "GO" reflects our focus on Google Earth as a foundational aspect of our work, emphasizing the Google Open Source community and its contributions.

## USE CASES

### üè∑Ô∏è Use Case of the Badging API  
GO Web Store leverages the **Badging API** to provide a more native app experience, inspired by **Project Fugu**.  
The Badging API enables dynamic badge updates directly within the PWA, enhancing user interaction during file downloads.  

#### Why the Badging API?  
Traditional download experiences rely on OS-level download bars or browser-specific badges (as shown below):  

1. **Usual Download**  
   ![Usual Download](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f7c0aa6f-2e7d-4e7a-a364-a66855d7d29e)  
   **Description:** A Chrome badge shows download counts.  

2. **What You Don‚Äôt Get with OS level Percentages**  
   ![What You Don‚Äôt Get](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f41f93f6-382f-4ed6-9fa4-9bc3d13aedfd)  
   **Description:** The default system download bar is displayed but lacks in-app progress details.  

#### Enhanced Experience with GO Web Store  
By integrating the **Fetch API**, GO Web Store transforms the download experience:  

- **In-app Percentage Experience**  
  ![In-app Percentage](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cdb81b7c-1c17-4032-846f-d2da7c03707a)  
  **Description:** Progress bars are displayed directly within the app, creating a seamless download experience.  

- **Native-like Badging Experience**  
  ![Badge Example](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6d40f963-261f-428f-a822-d0acd38d9f2c)  
  **Description:** The PWA shows a badge indicating there's any active downloads happening, resembling native app behavior.

## Expanding Compatibility  

Currently, the Badging API is supported on **MacOS** and **Windows** via Chrome, and in Safari.  
Our goal is to:  
- Extend support to Linux for Chromium.  
- Advocate for adoption by other browser engines, such as **Firefox (Gecko)**.

## Inspiration and Motivation  

This project is inspired by **Thomas Steiner**, a Google DevRel, and **Project Fugu's** mission to push real-world use cases for APIs. The focus on enhancing the user experience aligns with Liquid Galaxy's vision to create impactful, accessible apps for diverse communities.
